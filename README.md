# circle

For one week, I kept track of my movements throughout the day. I kept notes on how when my departure and arrival times, where I started and ended, and my method of travel. The data was then processed and visualized using D3.js.

How to Read:

Starting from the center, each concentric circle represents a different location. For example, the innermost circle is home. The circle can be read like a 24 hour clock, with 12AM at the very top. Each straight line represents a journey from point A to point B and its color indicates the transportation type (see key below). Black arcs indicate how long I stayed in one place.
